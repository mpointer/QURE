## Key Talking Points

### Opening (Executive Summary)
> "QURE transforms exception resolution from a manual 15-minute bottleneck to a 2-minute automated intelligence process. We're seeing 65% auto-resolution rates with 92% efficiency gains, translating to $187K annual savings for a typical deployment."

### Objection: "How is this different from RPA?"
> "Traditional RPA breaks on exceptions - that's the whole problem. QURE combines 11 specialized AI agents: rules engines for compliance, algorithms for exact matching, ML models for pattern recognition, and LLMs for contextual reasoning. It's not brittle automation - it's intelligent decision-making with human oversight."

### Objection: "What about accuracy?"
> "We maintain 95%+ accuracy with multi-agent validation. Every decision includes uncertainty scores, and medium-confidence cases route to human review. Plus, citations ensure no hallucinations - every AI conclusion points to source data."

### Objection: "How does it scale?"
> "Let me show you." ‚Üí Go to What-If Scenarios, set volume to 10x ‚Üí "Linear scaling without additional headcount. The only constraint is compute, not humans."

### Closing (Business Case)
> "Based on your 1,000 monthly cases and $100/hour loaded cost, you're looking at a 12.5-month payback and $562K net savings over 3 years. That's a 375% ROI."

## Visual Design Philosophy

All business pages use:
- **Gradient cards** for hero metrics (eye-catching)
- **Color coding**: Green (positive), Red (negative), Blue (information)
- **Large fonts** for key numbers (readable from distance)
- **Progressive disclosure** (expandable details)
- **Minimal text** (visuals over walls of text)

---

## Customization Tips

### Adjusting ROI Assumptions
Edit `business_demo_enhancements.py`:
- Line 406: `manual_time_per_case = 15` ‚Üí Adjust per your industry
- Line 407-408: QURE processing times
- Line 421: `fte_hourly_rate = 100` ‚Üí Adjust per geography/role

### Adding New Verticals
1. Add data to `/data/synthetic/{new_vertical}/`
2. Update `vertical_icons` dict in main()
3. Add vertical description
4. Generate 20 synthetic cases

### Custom Branding
- Logo: Replace `Qure_logo.png` in root
- Colors: Edit gradient hex codes in markdown sections
- Terminology: Update "QRU" ‚Üí your preferred agent naming

---

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error: business_demo_enhancements
**Solution**: Ensure `business_demo_enhancements.py` is in the `ui/` directory

### Navigation Not Working
**Solution**: Check that radio button selection logic correctly sets `page` variable

### Data Not Loading
**Solution**: Verify synthetic data exists in `/data/synthetic/{vertical}/`
```bash
ls data/synthetic/finance/
# Should show: gl_transactions.json, bank_transactions.json, expected_matches.json
```

### Plotly Charts Not Rendering
**Solution**:
```bash
pip install plotly==5.18.0
```
