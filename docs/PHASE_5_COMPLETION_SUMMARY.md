- Selects the optimal subset of QRUs to invoke
- Estimates costs and execution time
- Generates detailed execution plans with reasoning

## 2. Orchestrator Integration (Phase 5b)

### Integration Architecture

The Orchestrator now has two workflow modes:

1. **Traditional Workflow**: Pre-defined workflow (legacy support)
2. **Intelligent Workflow**: Planner-driven dynamic workflow

### Changes Made

**File**: `agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`

#### New Imports
```python
from dataclasses import asdict
from agents.planner import PlannerQRU, ExecutionPlan
```

#### New Attributes
```python
def __init__(self):
    # ...existing code...
    self.planner = PlannerQRU()
    self.execution_plans: Dict[str, ExecutionPlan] = {}
```

#### New Method: `start_intelligent_workflow()`
```python
def start_intelligent_workflow(
    self,
    case_id: str,
    case_data: Dict[str, Any],
    vertical: str,
) -> str:
    """
    Start workflow with Planner QRU intelligence

    Steps:
    1. Invoke Planner QRU to analyze case
    2. Generate optimized ExecutionPlan
    3. Dynamically construct workflow
    4. Execute workflow
    """
```

This method:
- Invokes Planner to analyze the case
- Caches the ExecutionPlan
- Builds dynamic workflow definition
- Registers and starts the workflow
- Logs cost/time estimates

#### New Method: `_build_workflow_from_plan()`
```python
def _build_workflow_from_plan(self, plan: ExecutionPlan) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Converts ExecutionPlan to workflow definition

    - Maps QRU names to agent names
    - Creates step dependencies (sequential pipeline)
    - Sets failure handling (continue or stop)
    """
```

#### New Method: `get_execution_plan()`
```python
def get_execution_plan(self, case_id: str) -> Optional[ExecutionPlan]:
    """Retrieve cached execution plan for a case"""
```

    complex_plan.estimated_total_cost: $0.0805
    Savings: 12.4% difference
    ✅ PASSED
```

#### Test 5: Dynamic Workflow Structure
```python
def test_dynamic_workflow_structure():

```
Reasoning: "Perfect match on amounts and dates. No SOX concerns."
Selected: Rules + Algorithms only
Cost: $0.0105 (87.7% savings)
```

**Complex Case** ($125K+ with mismatches):
```
Reasoning: "High-value transaction ($125K) requires SOX compliance review.
            Amount mismatch and foreign currency (EUR) add complexity.

```

### Healthcare: Prior Authorization

**In-Network, Non-Experimental**:
```
Business Problem: Healthcare: Prior Authorization
Reasoning: "Standard procedure with in-network provider.
            Medical policy rules sufficient for approval decision."
Selected: Rules (medical policy and coverage rules)
QRUs Skipped: ML Model, GenAI (not needed for straightforward cases)
```

**Experimental Procedure**:
```
Reasoning: "Experimental procedure flag detected.
            Requires clinical judgment beyond policy rules.
            GenAI needed for medical necessity assessment."
Selected: Rules + GenAI + Assurance
```

### Insurance: Subrogation

**Multi-Party Liability**:
```
Business Problem: Insurance: Subrogation Recovery
Reasoning: "Multiple liable parties detected.
            ML Model for subrogation likelihood prediction.

Selected: Rules + ML Model + Assurance
Business Complexity: +2 points (multi-party liability)
```

### Retail: Inventory Reconciliation

```
Business Problem: Retail: Inventory Reconciliation

            Shrinkage analysis may be required."
Selected: Data + Rules + Algorithm (quantity matching)
```

### Manufacturing: PO Matching

```
Business Problem: Manufacturing: PO Matching
Reasoning: "3-way match: PO ↔ Receipt ↔ Invoice.
            Quality issues may require inspection."
Selected: Data + Rules + Algorithm + (conditionally) Assurance
```

## 4. Cost Optimization Analysis

### Baseline: Full Pipeline Cost

```
All 11 QRUs invoked:
- Retriever: $0.001
- Data: $0.002
- Rules: $0.0005
- Algorithm: $0.001
- ML Model: $0.050
- GenAI: $0.020
- Assurance: $0.005
- Policy: $0.001
- Action: $0.001
- Learning: $0.001
- Orchestration: $0.001
TOTAL: $0.0855
```

### Optimized: Simple Case

```
6 QRUs invoked:
- Retriever: $0.001
- Data: $0.002
- Rules: $0.0005
- Algorithm: $0.001
- Policy: $0.001
- Action: $0.001
TOTAL: $0.0105

Savings: $0.0750 (87.7%)
```

### Cost Distribution

| Complexity | QRUs | Cost | Savings |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| Simple (0-2) | 6 | $0.0105 | 87.7% |
| Moderate (3-5) | 7-8 | $0.0305 - $0.0605 | 64%-29% |
| Complex (6-8) | 9-10 | $0.0805 | 5.8% |
| Highly Complex (9-11) | 11 | $0.0855 | 0% |

### Projected Annual Savings

Assuming:
- 10,000 cases/month
- 60% simple, 25% moderate, 10% complex, 5% highly complex

```
Monthly Cost Breakdown:
- Simple (6,000 × $0.0105) = $63
- Moderate (2,500 × $0.0455 avg) = $114
- Complex (1,000 × $0.0805) = $81
- Highly Complex (500 × $0.0855) = $43
TOTAL: $301/month

Without Planner (all full pipeline):
10,000 × $0.0855 = $855/month

Monthly Savings: $554 (64.8%)
Annual Savings: $6,648
```

## 6. Key Design Decisions

### 1. Business Identity First

**Decision**: Build domain expertise directly into the Planner
**Rationale**: The Planner should act as a business consultant, not just a technical router
**Implementation**: 16 BusinessProblemClass types with vertical-specific logic

### 2. Complexity Scoring Over Rules

**Decision**: Use multi-factor scoring (0-11 points) instead of binary rules
**Rationale**: Allows nuanced decision-making and gradual pipeline scaling
**Implementation**: 4 factors (data completeness, conflicts, precedents, business-specific)

### 3. Cost-Aware Orchestration

**Decision**: Include cost estimation in every ExecutionPlan
**Rationale**: Enable cost monitoring and budget management
**Implementation**: Per-QRU cost model with real-time estimates

### 4. Dynamic Workflow Generation

**Decision**: Generate workflows at runtime from ExecutionPlan
**Rationale**: Eliminates need for pre-defined workflows per vertical
**Implementation**: `_build_workflow_from_plan()` method

### 5. Execution Plan Caching

**Decision**: Cache ExecutionPlan by case_id
**Rationale**: Enable audit trail and post-hoc analysis
**Implementation**: `execution_plans` dict in Orchestrator

---

## 7. Future Enhancements (Phase 5c-5d)

### Phase 5c: Learning Loop (Deferred)

**Objective**: Learn from actual outcomes to improve predictions

**Planned Features**:
1. **Outcome Feedback**: Track actual cost vs. estimated cost
2. **Classification Learning**: Update complexity scoring weights
3. **Vertical Adaptation**: Learn vertical-specific patterns

**Implementation Timeline**: After initial production deployment

### Phase 5d: UI & Monitoring (Next)

**Objective**: Visualize Planner decisions and track savings

**Planned Features**:
1. **Execution Plan Display**: Show selected/skipped QRUs with reasoning
2. **Cost Savings Dashboard**: Real-time tracking of optimization
3. **QRU Utilization Metrics**: Heatmap of QRU invocation frequency
4. **Business Problem Distribution**: Pie chart of problem classifications

**Implementation Timeline**: Next session
