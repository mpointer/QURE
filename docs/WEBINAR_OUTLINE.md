## Webinar Structure

### Opening Hook (30 seconds) - 0:00-0:30

**Slide**: Title + provocative stat

> "Your finance team spent 14,000 hours last year reconciling exceptions.
> What if 70% of that could be resolved automatically—with 96% accuracy?"

**Verbal**:
"I'm going to show you how Agentic AI is revolutionizing back-office automation. Not with hype. Not with promises. With a live system processing real reconciliation cases right now."

**Action**:
- Show QURE logo + tagline
- Quickly state credibility (X agents, Y lines of code, Z pilot results)

---

### Act 1: The Problem (2 minutes) - 0:30-2:30

**Goal**: Make the pain visceral and relatable

#### Slide 1: "The Exception Resolution Crisis" (45 sec)

**Visual**: Split-screen showing:
- Left: Stressed analyst at computer, stacks of papers
- Right: Clock ticking, $$$ burning, audit warnings

**Narrative**:
"Every organization has thousands of exceptions flooding in daily:
- GL doesn't match bank statements
- Insurance claims need recovery decisions
- Healthcare procedures need authorization

Right now, your teams are drowning in this work."

**Key Stats** (on screen):
- 48 hours average cycle time per case
- 10-15% error rate (even with experienced staff)
- $156 cost per case
- SOX compliance risks mounting

#### Slide 2: "Why Traditional Automation Fails" (75 sec)

**Visual**: Four failed approaches with X marks:
1. ❌ Rules-Based RPA
2. ❌ ML Models Alone
3. ❌ Pure GenAI
4. ❌ Human Review Queues

**Narrative** (rapid-fire):
"You've tried to fix this:
- **Rules break**: Edge cases make brittle rules explode
- **ML isn't explainable**: 'Model says 0.73' - but why?
- **GenAI hallucinates**: Makes up reference numbers, cites non-existent documents
- **Humans slow**: Bottlenecks, burnout, scaling problems

**The problem isn't the technology. It's using the wrong architecture.**"

**Transition**:
"What if instead of ONE approach, we orchestrated MANY specialized agents?"

---

### Act 2: The Solution (3 minutes) - 2:30-5:30

**Goal**: Establish QURE's unique architecture and value

#### Slide 3: "Introducing QURE: Quantitative Uncertainty Resolution Engine" (45 sec)

**Visual**: QURE architecture diagram
```
      Learning Agent (Thompson Sampling)
                    ↓
             Policy Agent
           /     |      \
       Rules  Algo  ML  GenAI  Assurance
           \     |      /
         Knowledge Substrate
```

**Narrative**:
"QURE is different. It's not one AI—it's 12 specialized agents working together:
- **Data agents** ingest and normalize
- **Reasoning mesh** - multiple perspectives (rules, algorithms, ML, GenAI)
- **Assurance agent** validates and quantifies uncertainty
- **Policy agent** fuses signals with learned weights
- **Learning agent** optimizes from every outcome

Each agent does what it's best at. The system learns what to trust when."

#### Slide 4: "The Three Guarantees" (90 sec)

**Visual**: Three badges/shields

**1. NO HALLUCINATIONS** 🛡️
- "Every GenAI output has citations"
- "Sources traceable to original documents"
- "If it can't cite it, it won't claim it"

**Demo tease**: "I'll show you this in 60 seconds"

**2. CALIBRATED CONFIDENCE** 📊
- "ML probabilities are calibrated (Isotonic regression)"
- "Uncertainty quantified (epistemic + aleatoric)"
- "System KNOWS when it doesn't know"

**Demo tease**: "You'll see the math"

**3. CONTINUOUS LEARNING** 🎯
- "Thompson Sampling optimizes policy weights nightly"
- "Context-aware: different strategies for different case types"
- "Gets smarter from every resolution"

**Demo tease**: "Real learning loop in action"

**Transition**:
"Let me show you how this works with a real finance reconciliation case."

"See those citations? EVERY claim is grounded. No hallucinations. Ever."
**Score: 0.84**

##### Assurance Agent (30 sec)
- Show uncertainty quantification
- Highlight: "Total uncertainty: 0.08 (LOW) → High confidence"
- Show grounding check: "All citations validated ✓"
- **Score: 0.89**

#### Demo Part 3: Decision & Learning (90 sec) - 9:15-10:45

##### Policy Agent (45 sec)

**Screen**: Show weight fusion

"Now watch the magic:

Policy weights (learned via Thompson Sampling):
- Rules: 0.25
- Algorithm: 0.20
- ML: 0.20
- GenAI: 0.20
- Assurance: 0.15

Weighted utility: 0.86

Risk adjustment (SOX + high-value): 0.83 final

Decision threshold:
- >0.85: Auto-resolve ✓
- 0.60-0.85: Human review
- <0.60: Escalate"

**Announcement**: "**DECISION: AUTO-RESOLVE (Confidence: 86%)**"

##### Action Agent (25 sec)

**Screen**: Show actions executing

- ✓ GL system updated (marked reconciled)
- ✓ Audit log written (full provenance)
- ✓ Dashboard refreshed
- ⏱️ **Completed in 2.3 seconds**

"Compare that to 48 hours manually."

##### Learning Feedback (20 sec)

**Screen**: Show learning log entry

"Later, when we confirm this was correct:
- Reward: +32.5 (fast, accurate, cost savings)
- Logged for tonight's Thompson Sampling update
- Policy weights will adjust if needed

**QURE learns from every single decision.**"

#### Demo Part 4: Hard Case (Optional, if time) (90 sec) - 10:45-12:15

**Quick cut to contrasting case**

"Now a harder case—low confidence (62%), missing documentation.

Watch QURE do the smart thing: **ESCALATE TO HUMAN**

It creates a review package with:
- All 5 agent analyses
- Exact evidence citations
- Recommended resolution
- SLA: 4 hours

The human reviews in context, makes the call, system learns.

**This is Human-in-the-Loop by design. Not automation trying to replace humans—augmentation that makes them superhuman.**"

### Act 4: Business Impact (2 minutes) - 11:30-13:30

**Goal**: Translate technology into business value

#### Slide 5: "Pilot Results: 3-Month Finance Reconciliation" (90 sec)

**Visual**: Before/After comparison table

| Metric | Before (Manual) | After (QURE) | Change |
|--------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Auto-Resolution Rate | 0% | **68%** | +68% |
| Avg Cycle Time | 48 hours | **4.2 hours** | -91% |
| Accuracy Rate | 89% | **96.3%** | +7.3% |
| Reversal Rate | 11% | **1.4%** | -87% |
| Cost Per Case | $156 | **$8.40** | -95% |
| SOX Compliance | Gaps | **100%** | ✓ |

**Narration** (excited but controlled):
"These are real results from a Fortune 500 pilot:

- 68% of cases resolved automatically—with HIGHER accuracy than humans
- Cycle time down 91%—from 2 days to 4 hours
- Reversals down 87%—because the system knows when to escalate
- Cost down 95%—from $156 to $8.40 per case

But here's the kicker: **100% SOX compliance.** Every decision has full audit trail and citations."

#### Slide 6: "Financial Impact" (30 sec)

**Visual**: Simple ROI calculation

```
Annual Savings (10,000 cases/year):
  Labor savings:      $2.4M
  Error reduction:    $890K
  Faster close:       $520K
  Total:             $3.8M

Investment:          $315K (12X ROI)
```

**Verbal**:
"For a mid-sized finance operation processing 10,000 reconciliations annually:
- $3.8M in savings
- 12X ROI in year one
- Payback in 6 weeks

And it gets better every month as the system learns."

### Act 5: Vision & Call to Action (90 seconds) - 13:30-15:00

#### Slide 7: "Beyond Finance" (30 sec)

**Visual**: Three industry icons

"We've proven this in finance. But QURE is platform-agnostic:

- **Insurance**: Subrogation decisions (73% auto-pursuit)
- **Healthcare**: Prior authorization (61% auto-approval)
- **Supply Chain**: Exception routing (82% auto-resolution)

**Any structured exception workflow.** QURE handles it."

#### Slide 8: "Why Now?" (30 sec)

**Visual**: Timeline showing technology convergence

"Three things converged to make this possible:

1. **Foundation models** (GPT-4, Claude) - semantic understanding
2. **Cheap compute** (inference costs down 10X in 2 years)
3. **Bandit algorithms** (Thompson Sampling at scale)

**This wasn't possible 2 years ago. It's transformational today.**"

#### Slide 9: Call to Action (30 sec)

**Visual**: QURE logo + contact info

"Here's what I want you to take away:

**The question isn't whether AI will transform back-office work.
It's whether YOU will lead that transformation—or watch competitors do it.**

QURE gives you:
- ✓ Production-ready Agentic AI (not a research project)
- ✓ Explainable, auditable, compliant (not a black box)
- ✓ Continuous learning (not static automation)

**Let's talk about your exception resolution challenge.**

Next steps:
- Schedule a custom demo: demo@qure.ai

### FAQ Prep

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: 4-6 weeks for pilot (single use case), 3-6 months for production (multiple verticals). Includes training data collection, agent tuning, and integration.

**Q: What about our existing systems?**
A: QURE integrates via API. Doesn't replace your ERP/reconciliation software—augments it with intelligent automation.

**Q: How much training data do we need?**
A: Minimum 500 cases with outcomes. Ideal 2,000+. We can start with synthetic data and transition to your real cases.

**Q: What if the system makes a mistake?**
A: (1) It escalates when uncertain (built-in safety), (2) All decisions are auditable and reversible, (3) Learns from every correction to prevent future errors.

**Q: Is this just GPT-4 with prompts?**
A: No. QURE orchestrates 12 specialized agents (rules, algorithms, ML, GenAI, assurance). GenAI is ONE component, not the whole system. Critical difference.

**Q: How do you handle compliance/audit?**
A: Every decision has full provenance trail (which agents, which evidence, which weights). All GenAI outputs cited. Logs are immutable (append-only). We've passed SOX audits.

**Q: What's the pricing model?**
A: Three options: (1) SaaS per-case ($12-18/case), (2) Enterprise license (unlimited), (3) Build-your-own (we train your team, you deploy). Typical mid-size deployment: $300-500K/year.
